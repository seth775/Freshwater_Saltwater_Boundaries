# Freshwater-Saltwater Boundaries

## Overview

This repository contains the supporting documentation and scripts for my senior capstone project, which focuses on investigating the subtle changes between freshwater and saltwater boundaries within data collected from a submarine aquifer outside of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. This project explores the nuances of these boundaries by processing raw seismic data and applying advanced analytical techniques.

## Project Description

The project is divided into two major notebooks to ensure clarity and reduction of clutter:

### 1. Initial Processing and Acoustic Impedance Analysis
- **Data Preparation**: Processing the raw seismic data using inter-system seismic techniques.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Filtering
  - Automatic Gain Control (AGC)
  - Depth Conversion
- **Acoustic Impedance**: Evaluating acoustic impedance to better understand material contrasts and their relevance to freshwater-saltwater transitions.

All of these steps are encapsulated in the **Initial Processing and Acoustic Impedance File**.

### 2. Seismic Processing
- **Data Analysis**: Further analysis of the processed and AGC data using advanced techniques to characterize boundary changes.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Amplitude Envelope Analysis
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Correlation Coefficients
  - Random Forest Classifiers

This phase is covered in the **Seismic Processing File**, which focuses on detecting and understanding the subtle variations between freshwater and saltwater boundaries.

## Files and Resources
- **Initial Processing and Acoustic Impedance File**: Contains the steps for filtering, AGC, depth conversion, and acoustic impedance analysis.
- **Seismic Processing File**: Includes scripts and methodologies for amplitude analysis, clustering, correlation, and classification.

Detailed explanations and insights into these methods are provided in the accompanying final report.

## Data Availability
Due to the large size of the raw and processed data files, they are not included in this repository. If you require access to the data, please contact me at:
